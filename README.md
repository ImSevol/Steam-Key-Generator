# Steam-Key-Generator

heck I just wanted to do something myself and decided to start with that. Sorry if the code is incomprehensible. I'm a noob. For It to work, select the file directory, the number of keys and the file extension in the MainActivity.java file in the Main method. If you want to remove long keys from generation, read the explanation in the same class in the GeneriteFile method and do as it says. Enjoy
